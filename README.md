# Citiscope

Do you want to find a person or agent for a specific service but don’t want to juggle with gazillion websites online to find out whose products or services is the best? And you also want to keep track of all the agents you have contacted or planned to contact? And lastly, you yourself want to provide services, and are looking for a common platform to get easy access to the clients? Citiscope is an app that strives to meet these requirements.

**So what does it do exactly?** 

*One*, it takes the service you want – let’s say you are looking for a doctor – and searches the internet for websites where there are information about doctors. It fetches these information, compiles them and shows them to you as cards for each doctor.

*Two*, you can filter your search results based on preferences you mention. With the Doctor example, a plausible filter would be the specialty of that doctor.

*Three*, you can contact an agent in two basic ways (provided the agent yields these information): calling and mailing. You can also locate him/her in a map. The UI is easy for anyone to use and these features are just a tap of a button away.

*Four*, you can save an Agent for future references, by bookmarking. Of course, you have to register in our app to enjoy this feature and the ones below.

*Five*, you can register in our app with your email. Easy and simple.

*Six*, now comes the fun part. You can be a client AND an/many Agent/s if you are registered. Open up an Agent Profile with your Client Profile on one of the Services the app provides (currently it provides four services – apartment renting, blood donation, doctor and tuition, and is based on our country Bangladesh). You can open as many Agent Profiles of any Service as you want. 

*Seven*, and lastly, there’s this poll. So what’s a poll doing here? We figured that there are so many services out there that we alone cannot cover them all. So we need our users to help us find them. A registered user can add a nomination in the poll and specify what it does and where to get its agents from online. A registered user can also vote for a nomination. An admin observes the poll and after a certain time will remove it from the poll if it does not get enough votes or if it gets a lot, in which case the nomination will be turned into a service in a later version. The nominator will get a notification in such cases. The poll is also a platform for startups to showcase their services.

Through this app we hope to provide users with an easy and efficient access to all the useful and frequently needed services right in the palm of their hands. And as a bonus, with the poll and agent registration service, we hope to see young and small businesses get recognized and flourish.
